This Python script is designed to address corruption in MOV and MP4 video files, facilitating their recovery and restoration. Unlike the CR2 file repair script, which targets Canon Raw Version 2 image files, this script focuses on multimedia container formats commonly used for storing video, audio, and metadata.
