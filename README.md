# Video-Repair-Tool
This Python script is designed to address corruption in MOV and MP4 video files, facilitating their recovery and restoration. Unlike the CR2 file repair script, which targets Canon Raw Version 2 image files, this script focuses on multimedia container formats commonly used for storing video, audio, and metadata.
